# alx-listing-app
The ALX Listing App is a modern, scalable Airbnb clone focused on property listings. This project lays the groundwork for building a responsive and user-friendly listing page using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It emphasizes clean architecture, reusable components, and production-ready configurations to support future development.

##Project Structure
This project follows a clean and organized folder structure to make the code easy to understand and maintain:

###components/ This folder holds reusable UI pieces like buttons and cards. Instead of rewriting the same design many times, you can just reuse a component from here.

###interfaces/ This is where all the TypeScript interfaces are stored. Interfaces help define the shape of your data (like what properties a card should have), making your code safer and easier to work with.

###constants/ This folder stores reusable values like configuration settings or labels that donâ€™t change (e.g., API URLs or text strings). Keeping them here makes it easier to update things from one place.

###public/assets/ This is where you put images, icons, and other media used in your app. These files can be accessed directly in your HTML or code.
